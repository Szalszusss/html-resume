<h1>The Best Movies According To Dorina</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>(500) Days Of Summer</h3>
<p>
It's a nice and cute romcom, but it has a deeper and more interesting meaning if you think about it a bit more. Also, it has a huge plot twist! It is most definately not your typical romantic movie;)<br>
"This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story."(quote from the movie)

<h3>Grown-Ups</h3>
<p>
The funniest movie ever. The best friendgroup.

<h3>Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift</h3>
